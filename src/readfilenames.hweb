@* Description of file name usage in DEGAS 2.

The names of most input and output files used by DEGAS 2 are specified
in a single file, currently called |degas2.in|.  The filenames given
therein are associated with the symbolic names which appear in the
rest of the code. These symbolic names should be self-describing;
more details about each of these files is given in the User's Manual.
The corresponding user-specified filenames (which can be an absolute
or relative UNIX path name) are stored in the |filenames_array| array.
The indices in that array corresponding to each symbolic name are given
by the above macros. The entries in the |degas2.in| file are of the form:

\begin{verbatim}
symbolic_name    actual_path_name
\end{verbatim}

The entries can be in any order. Comments begin with a ``\#'' and be
on a separate line or at the end of a line. Spaces and blank lines
are ignored. Unneeded filenames (see comments at the top of this
file) do not have to be included. If you forget to specify a needed
filename, DEGAS 2 will should give an error like:

\begin{verbatim}
Assertion failed (pmimatread.web): tempfile!=char_undef
\end{verbatim}

An example |degas2.in| file is distributed in the |src| directory of
DEGAS 2. Other examples are included in |examples| directories.
The |degas2.in| file {\em must} be in your current ``run'' directory
(e.g., \verb+degas2/SUN+). Files referred to by |degas2.in| in the
|data| directory should not be modified by the user. If changes need
to be made, the user should make copies of the files in the ``run''
directory or elsewhere. The user is advised to choose filenames
which will aid in the tracking of run variants.

To add new files to the above list:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Create a suggestive symbolic file name,
  \item Assign the next integer to it in the above macro list,
  \item Increment |filenames_max|,
  \item Make corresponding changes to |readfilenames.web| (see
the introduction there).
\end{enumerate}
